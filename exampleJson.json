The rule of Yoweri MUSEVENI since 1986 has brought relative stability and economic growth to Uganda. In December 2017, parliament approved the removal of presidential age limits, thereby making it possible for MUSEVENI to continue standing for office.

Except in urban areas, actual fertility exceeds women‚Äôs desired fertility by one or two children, which is indicative of the widespread unmet need for contraception, lack of government support for family planning, and a cultural preference for large families. High numbers of births, short birth intervals, and the early age of childbearing contribute to Uganda‚Äôs high maternal mortality rate. Gender inequities also make fertility reduction difficult; women on average are less-educated, participate less in paid employment, and often have little say in decisions over childbearing and their own reproductive health. However, even if the birth rate were significantly reduced, Uganda‚Äôs large pool of women entering reproductive age ensures rapid population growth for decades to come.\nUnchecked, population increase will further strain the availability of arable land and natural resources and overwhelm the country‚Äôs limited means for providing food, employment, education, health care, housing, and basic services. The country‚Äôs north and northeast lag even further behind developmentally than the rest of the country as a result of long-term conflict (the Ugandan Bush War 1981-1986 and more than 20 years of fighting between the Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army (LRA) and Ugandan Government forces), ongoing inter-communal violence, and periodic natural disasters.\nUganda has been both a source of refugees and migrants and a host country for refugees. In 1972, then President Idi AMIN, in his drive to return Uganda to Ugandans, expelled the South Asian population that composed a large share of the country‚Äôs business people and bankers. Since the 1970s, thousands of Ugandans have emigrated, mainly to southern Africa or the West, for security reasons, to escape poverty, to search for jobs, and for access to natural resources. The emigration of Ugandan doctors and nurses due to low wages is a particular concern given the country‚Äôs shortage of skilled health care workers. Africans escaping conflicts in neighboring states have found refuge in Uganda since the 1950s; the country currently struggles to host tens of thousands from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and other nearby countries.","age_structure":{"0_to_14":{"percent":48.21,"males":10548913,"females":10304876},"15_to_24":{"percent":20.25,"males":4236231,"females":4521698},"25_to_54":{"percent":26.24,"males":5202570,"females":6147304},"55_to_64":{"percent":2.91,"males":579110,"females":681052},"65_and_over":{"percent":2.38,"males":442159,"females":589053},"date":"2020"},"dependency_ratios":{"ratios":{"total_dependency_ratio":{"value":92.3,"units":"%"},"youth_dependency_ratio":{"value":88.5,"units":"%"},"elderly_dependency_ratio":{"value":3.8,"units":"%"},"potential_support_ratio":{"value":26.2,"units":"%"}},"date":"2020"},"median_age":{"total":{"value":15.7,"units":"years"},"male":{"value":14.9,"units":"years"},"female":{"value":16.5,"units":"years"},"global_rank":227,"date":"2020"},"population_growth_rate":{"growth_rate":3.34,"global_rank":5,"date":"2020"},"birth_rate":{"births_per_1000_population":42.3,"global_rank":3,"date":"2020"},"death_rate":{"deaths_per_1000_population":5.3,"global_rank":193,"date":"2020"},"net_migration_rate":{"migrants_per_1000_population":-3.5,"global_rank":184,"date":"2020"},"population_distribution":"population density is relatively high in comparison to other African nations;

Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the economy, employing 72% of the work force. The country‚Äôs export market suffered a major slump following the outbreak of conflict in South Sudan, but has recovered lately, largely due to record coffee harvests, which account for 16% of exports, and increasing gold exports, which account for 10% of exports. Uganda has a small industrial sector that is dependent on imported inputs such as refined oil and heavy equipment. Overall, productivity is hampered by a number of supply-side constraints, including insufficient infrastructure, lack of modern technology in agriculture, and corruption.\nUganda‚Äôs economic growth has slowed since 2016 as government spending and public debt has grown. Uganda‚Äôs budget is dominated by energy and road infrastructure spending, while Uganda relies on donor support for long-term drivers of growth, including agriculture, health, and education. The largest infrastructure projects are externally financed through concessional loans, but at inflated costs. As a result, debt servicing for these loans is expected to rise.\nOil revenues and taxes are expected to become a larger source of government funding as oil production starts in the next three to 10 years. Over the next three to five years, foreign investors are planning to invest $9 billion in production facilities projects, $4 billion in an export pipeline, as well as in a $2-3 billion refinery to produce petroleum products for the domestic and East African Community markets. Furthermore, the government is looking to build several hundred million dollars‚Äô worth of highway projects to the oil region.\nUganda faces many economic challenges. Instability in South Sudan has led to a sharp increase in Sudanese refugees and is disrupting Uganda's main export market. Additional economic risks include: poor economic management, endemic corruption, and the government‚Äôs failure to invest adequately in the health, education, and economic opportunities for a burgeoning young population. Uganda has one of the lowest electrification rates in Africa - only 22% of Ugandans have access to electricity, dropping to 10% in rural areas.","gdp":{"purchasing_power_parity":{"annual_values":[{"value":89190000000,"units":"USD","date":"2017"},{"value":85070000000,"units":"USD","date":"2016"},{"value":83140000000,"units":"USD","date":"2015"}],"global_rank":89,"note":"data
